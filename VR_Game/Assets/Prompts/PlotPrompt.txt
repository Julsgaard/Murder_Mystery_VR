Riley Anderson, the newest addition to the friend group consisting of Ashley Rose, Chris Walker, Jens Johnson, Leonard Hawthorne, and Quinn Parker, eagerly accepted the invitation for a thrilling adventure to an abandoned mansion. 
The group, determined to solidify their bond with Riley, had been searching for the perfect group activity to initiate their journey together. 
Quinn, the group's horror enthusiast, extended an invitation to explore Ravenscroft Manor, a mysterious old mansion she had heard about, and spend the night as a challenge. 
The allure of the unknown and the prospect of adventure proved irresistible to all.

Together, the friends embarked on a bus journey, winding through desolate roads that led them to the foreboding Ravenscroft Manor, shrouded in secrets. 
As night descended, the mansion loomed ominously against the moonlit sky, casting long, eerie shadows that seemed to dance in the chilly breeze. 
But the true test of their unity and friendship lay ahead. In the early morning hours, at 5 am, a blood-curdling scream shattered the silence of the dimly lit halls within the mansion. 
Racing to the source of the sound, they found Chris lying lifeless under mysterious circumstances. 
Panic and fear gripped the group as the grim possibility set inâ€”that one of their own had been involved in their friend's tragic and puzzling demise. 
Suspicion and mistrust began to cast a shadow over the group, and the atmosphere grew tense, forcing them all to confront the darkness within their ranks.
