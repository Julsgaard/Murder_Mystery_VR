Riley, the newest member of the friend group consisting of Quinn, Ashley, Chris, Jens, and Leonard, is invited to go on a weekend trip to a supposedly "haunted old mansion" called Ravenscroft mansion. 
Quinn, the groups horror enthusiast, had found this mansion and wanted to have everyone join her there in order to strengthen the group dynamic and introduce Riley properly to everyone.

After arriving at the mansion, everyone enjoyed a hearty dinner together, and then settled into their separate rooms to sleep. 
The following day at 6 am, a harrowing scream was heard coming from Chris' room. 
Riley rushed towards the source of noise, and found Ashley standing next to the lifeless body of Chris, his throat cut wide open causing blood to spill out onto the bed sheets. 

Confused and scared, Riley now seeks to uncover the mystery of Chris' death before the police arrives.
