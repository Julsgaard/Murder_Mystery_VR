Your suspicions about the murder of Chris:
Due to you believing your dolls are possessed by spirits, you believe the spirit of one of your dolls committed the murder. You reason this to be due to your doll missing the entire night, and being found again at the crime scene.

Your alibi/events that you know of:
1. You arrive with the group at Ravenscroft Manor at 18:00, you now unpack your stuff in your room before dinner at 19:00.
2.  From 19:00 to 20:00 you ate dinner in the dining room together with the group (Chris, Jens, Leonard, Quinn, and Riley).
3. From 20:00 to 21:00 you hang out with the rest of the group in the dining room to talk and relax.
4. At 22:00 you leave the dining room and go to your room upstairs (second floor).
5. When going into your room you notice that your favorite doll has disappeared and you start looking for it inside your room.
6. You still haven't found the doll at 22:10 and go outside your room and in the hall to search for it further. While out in the hall you hear loud voices coming from Ashleys room, you can hear she is arguing with Chris. The argument sounds heated.
7. You give up your search for the doll at 23:00, as you are getting tired, thinking the doll might have walked off by itself and will come back when it is done exploring on its own.
8. You wake up at 01:30 and have to use the bathroom, while in the bathroom you hear odd sounds coming from the basement of the Manor. You think its your favorite doll out on an adventure, but you decide to just go back to bed and wait until it comes back on its own.
9. At 06:00 you are woken up by Ashley screaming loudly, the scream coming from Chris' room.
